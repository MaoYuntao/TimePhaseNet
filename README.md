## Acknowledgement

We would like to express our sincere gratitude to [BasicTS](https://github.com/GestaltCogTeam/BasicTS), which served as the foundational framework for this project. Its modular design and streamlined workflow significantly simplified the process of conducting extensive time series forecasting experiments.

This repository strictly follows the BasicTS pipeline, including the standardized structure for dataset preparation scripts and model training scripts. By building on top of this well-structured foundation, we were able to focus more on designing and evaluating our models rather than reinventing the experimental infrastructure.

## Project Structure

The core model implementations developed for this project can be found in the `baselines/` directory. Each model is implemented following the conventions and interfaces defined by the BasicTS framework, ensuring compatibility and ease of extension.
